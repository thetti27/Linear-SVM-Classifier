# Linear-SVM-Classifier ðŸ“ˆ
In this project, we aim to explore the power of SVMs in classification tasks and demonstrate how to create a linear SVM classifier using Python's scikit-learn library within a Jupyter notebook environment.

Our repository contains the Jupyter notebook along with all the necessary data and code to replicate our experiments and reproduce our results. We hope that this project will serve as a useful resource for anyone looking to learn about SVMs or implement a linear classifier for their own classification tasks.

Thank you for checking out our project and we welcome any feedback or contributions! ðŸ“±
